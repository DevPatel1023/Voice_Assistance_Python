# Voice-Controlled Assistant Internship Project

Welcome to the Voice-Controlled Assistant Internship Project! This project was developed during an internship to learn and apply voice recognition, and basic automation using Python.

## Project Overview

The Voice-Controlled Assistant is a Python-based application that allows users to interact with their computer through voice commands. Inspired by fictional AI assistants like Jarvis from the Iron Man series, this project demonstrates the integration of voice recognition and automation.

Key Features:
- Voice recognition using the SpeechRecognition library
- Text-to-speech conversion with the pyttsx3 library
- Basic automation tasks, including opening websites, telling jokes, and playing music
- Customizable and extensible for future enhancements

## Getting Started

To get started with the Voice-Controlled Assistant, follow these steps:

1.Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).
2.Navigate to the directory where your project files, including the requirements.txt file, are located using the cd command.
3.Command:cd path/to/project
4.Run the following command to install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:
5.Command:pip install -r requirements.txt
6.Activate the virtual environment:
7.Command:myenv\Scripts\activate
8.Run the Python Script:
Command:python main.py



Customization: Customize the assistant's functionality by modifying the code in main.py. You can change the wake word, add new voice commands, or integrate additional features.

Run the Assistant: Run the script using the following command:
python main.py
Wake Word Activation: To activate the assistant, say the wake word you've configured (default is "Hey Jarvis"). The assistant will respond and await further commands.

Usage
The Voice-Controlled Assistant can perform various tasks. Here are some sample commands you can try:

"Tell me a joke" - The assistant tells a random joke.
"Search the web for [query]" - Perform a Google search with the given query.
"Play music" - Play a specific music file (customize the file path in the code).
"What's the time?" - Get the current time.
For opening websites, you can simply say "Open [website name]" for supported websites (e.g., Google, YouTube, etc.).

Acknowledgment
This project was developed during an internship to gain practical experience in programming and artificial intelligence. Special thanks to the internship program for providing this learning opportunity.

Future Enhancements
In the future, this project can be extended with the following improvements:

Advanced natural language processing for better user interaction.
Integration with external APIs for real-time information retrieval.
Enhanced error handling and user feedback.
